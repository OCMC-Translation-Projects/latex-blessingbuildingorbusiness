Brethren, you are God's field, God's building. According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder, I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it. For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

O God Almighty, who made the heavens in wisdom and set the foundations of the earth firmly in place, who through our Lord Jesus Christ built the Church and established it unshaken upon the rock of faith; do you, the same Lord, the great Architect and builder, provider and sustainer of all the world, look upon us and bless the works of our hands. In your name we lay these foundations today, and we ask that in your power you may make them firm; for we are not wasting our labors by erecting this building on the sand, but on you, the unshakeable rock, do we lay its foundations, so that if the rain should pour, the rivers should overflow, the winds should blow, it will neither fall nor be disturbed. Bless in peace our undertakings and bring them to a successful conclusion; for we did not gain this land by fire or sword, but by honest sweat and the pursuit of good works; and let this property you have entrusted to our stewardship endure for ever and ever. For in obedience to you we accomplish all these things, working by the power and to the glory of you, our Father in heaven, and your only-begotten Son and creative Word, and your holy and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages.

Holy brethren, who share in a heavenly call, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses-also was faithful in God's house. Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.

Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, but Christ was faithful over God's house as a Son. And we are his house if we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope.

Let us attend. Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up to him and said to him: Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today. So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it they all murmured: `He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner'. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord: `Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold'. And Jesus said to him: 'Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost'.

Brethren, we command you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is living in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, we did not eat anyone's bread without paying, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you. It was not because we have not that right, but to give you in our conduct an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: If anyone will not work, let him not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work in quietness and to earn their own living.

The Lord told the following parable: A man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more. So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying: `Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more'. His master said to him: `Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master'. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying: `Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more' His master said to him: `Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master'. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying: `Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours'. But his master answered him: `You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not winnow;. Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents. For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away". As he said this, he cried out: `He who has ears to hear, let him hear'.
